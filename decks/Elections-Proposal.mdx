# Workshop Proposal
## Title
Analyzing OpenFEC Finacial Trends
---

# Specific Topic
- We are going to use the OpenFEC API Election endpoint to visualize data for total disbursements and total receipts for Presidential candidates for the last 30 elections.
- (our example) Graph will compare this financial information over time and for both the Democratic and Republican parties. 
- Comparing one specific data point for Democratics and Republicans from 1950-2016

---

# Interactive Component
- We will have students visualize data from the same endpoint but for cash_on_hand_end_period
- They will be using the API to record 3 specific data for each candiate during that election year into a bar graph using Chartjs.

# Code Deliverables
## Week 2
- Code out total disbursements and total receipts (Work on together)

## Week 3
- Finish up any unfinished work from week 2 + complete interactive activity (Work on together)

## Week 4
- Finish up any unfinished code from interactive activity
- Work on presentation slides (will decide how to split up)

# Slide Outline
What is a general roadmap for your slides?
- Intro to tech (Chartjs, d3js)
- Visualize information from API and Chartjs (also explain how to get the JSON from the website)
- Explain and present our code
- Present interactive activity prompt
- Conclusion and why its important
---

# Timing
Each workshop should be around an hour to 90 minutes. How long will your workshop be?
- An hour
---

# Motivation behind project
What motivated your duo to pursue this idea?
- Explored the API and searched through to find interesting information
- The data from the API allows us to look in to how much money each candiate is spending and how much is the 'sweet spot'
- Comparing the Democrats and Republicans, we want to figure out if money is a factor in winning.
- Importance: Can we use information from the past to gain insight into right amount to spend on an election? Can this help us in predicting results?

# Explain difficulty/prior experience needed
Is there any prior experience needed for this workshop? Please be specific.
- Some basic experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript would be helpful, but not neccessarily required

# Technologies that will be used
- Chartjs/D3js
- Postman
