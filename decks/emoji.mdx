# Workshop Proposal: Emoji Sentiment Data
 
---
 
# Specific Idea
Ideas:
1. predicting a tweet's emotion based on emojis used
- predicting a tweet’s emotion -> generalize to predict general attitude from multiple tweets on a specific event? (tracking hashtags) / predict someone’s general feeling (in a week/month/year) by analyzing emojis in a person’s tweets.
- what tweets are we analyzing?
2. words to emojis: emotion translator (wrote about this below!)

# Interactive Component
- walk thru concepts taught and teach to translate concepts into code
- present prompts and ask workshop participants how they would code it
- then search for and use a recent tweet from a celebrity or workshop participant and test code
- or search for and use any form of text from the internet and ask all participants to test on text
 
---
 
# Code Deliverables
- week-by-week plan:
 - week 1: code for reading and analyzing tweets/ texts
 - week 2: code for identifying key terms for the emotions they convey (idea #2) / identifying the emojis in tweets (idea #1)
 - week 3: code for incorporating tech for translating between emotions and emojis

# Slide Outline
- PART 1: Introduction and motivation
 - introduce workshop and motivation behind it
 - define emojis and their relation to emotion and communication
 - goal of the workshop, what coding techniques and technologies are being taught
- PART 2: Concepts and code breakdown
 - introduce concepts (analyzing tweets? Dataset, unicode value?), new coding techniques and terms (twitter API, python libraries)
 - display how concepts translate into code concepts
 - walkthrough of coding concepts, use graphs and visuals
- PART 3: Interactive activity
 - have participants try writing code on their own
 - suggest an action program should perform and help participants write code for it (activity short examples)
 - for example, code from translating "happy" into smiley face emoji (ideas #2)
- for example, code for recognizing a smiley face and output by labeling it as a positive tweets (idea #1)

# Timing
- time limit: 90 min to 120 min
- PART 1: 15 min
- PART 2: 45 min
- PART 3: 30 min
 
---
 
# Motivation Behind Projects
- impact and influence of emojis in communication is increasing
- emojis have been taking over the way people communicate with each other online
- emojis help by adding personality and clarity with conveyed emotions
- sometimes people express their attitudes and opinions vaguely through words, analyzing emojis could help predict the tweet’s attitude towards certain events. (- can apply to social, political… issues)
- workshop can show how people interpret text into emotion

# Difficulty/Prior experience
- easy/medium
- basic python knowledge (ECS32A level)
- prior experience with twitter API? 
 
---
 
# Technologies that will be used
- analyzing tweets
- read in dataset
- python libraries
