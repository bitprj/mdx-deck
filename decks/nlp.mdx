- Information Extraction --> Sentiment Analysis
- Machine Translation 
- Text Classification

<L.Column>

## Before Deep Learning

### The following techniques were used for the machines to understand the language.
- Syntax (POS Tagging, Named Entity Recognition)
- Semantics (Semantic Role Labelling)
- Dialogs (Dialog Act Tagging)
