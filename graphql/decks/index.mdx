# What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a data query 
and manipulation language for APIs, 
and a runtime for fulfilling queries 
with existing data.

---

# Examples/uses

# Using GraphiQL
GraphiQL is the GraphQL IDE
access it when the site's dev server is running
usually at http://localhost:8000/___graphql (3 underscores)

<Notes>
use GraphiQL to explore and see all the data you have access to
you can interactively construct full queries by clicking through
available fields and inputs
after you construct your query, you simply can copy and paste
</Notes>

# Basic Query

<Notes>
At its simplest, GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on 
objects. Let's start by looking at a very simple query and 
the result we get when we run it
query has exactly the same shape as the result. 
This is essential to GraphQL, because you always get back what 
you expect, and the server knows exactly what fields the client 
is asking for.
