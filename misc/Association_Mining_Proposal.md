# Workshop Proposal

### Specific Topic
_Recommending frequently bought products to potential end-users using Association mining._



### Interactive Component
_Each workshop must have an original, interactive component._
_Calculating the frequently bought items and every correct answer will get a reward._
_This will help the students to understand the working behind the apriori algorithm._



### Code Deliverables
_In Weeks 2-3, your duo must code out the interactive component, as well as any other code needed for the entire workshop. 
What coding tasks do you need to complete? Each task should also come with what week each task will be completed as well as who is responsible for each task.
Please be specific._
_Also, you can use Week 4 to complete code deliverables. Note that this is highly **discouraged** because Week 4 is reserved for finishing touches and preparing the presentation._

- [ Preprocessing data]
- [ Association Mining using the Apriori Algorithm]
- [ Trick to reduce the huge number of pairs generated in the algorithm]
- [ Formatting the output]

### Slide Outline
_What is a general roadmap for your slides?_

* Define the dataset and what features we choose
* About Association mining
* How will we use the algorithm to detect the frequently bought items
* Other algorithms which students can research

### Timing
_Each workshop should be around an hour to 90 minutes. How long will your workshop be?
_Planned to be precisely one hour on the dot but might run up to 90 minutes depending on the Q and A section._
_Preprocessing the data will take less amount of time approcimately 10 minutes as the data is already clean._
_The algorithm will take 40 minutes to explain but the running time might vary depending on machines._
_Last 10 minutes will be allocated to discussing other algorithms and QnA section._


### Motivation behind project
_What motivated your duo to pursue this idea?_
_Businesses need to expand their business and one of the crucial components of any successful business is customers and their needs. Recommending the customers what are the frequently bought goods together is a good way to enhance the business sales._


### Explain difficulty/prior experience needed
_Is there any prior experience needed for this workshop? Please be specific._
_Python (Pandas, Numpy libraries)_


### Technologies that will be used
_Please be specific.
* Python
* PySpark
