# Workshop Proposal

### Specific Topic
 . Utilizing association mining to look for interesting patterns in transactional databases.
 . Recommending Frequently bought products to potential end-users.



### Interactive Component
_Each workshop must have an original, interactive component._
. A simple model of the implementation of the method.
We can select the customer and then see the recommended product.
. Explaining the order of growth as one of the vital components

### Code Deliverables
_In Weeks 2-3, your duo must code out the interactive component, as well as any other code needed for the entire workshop. 
What coding tasks do you need to complete? Each task should also come with what week each task will be completed as well as who is responsible for each task.
Please be specific._
_Also, you can use Week 4 to complete code deliverables. Note that this is highly **discouraged** because Week 4 is reserved for finishing touches and preparing the presentation._
