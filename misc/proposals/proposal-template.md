# Workshop Proposal

### Specific Topic
_What will your workshop be about?_

The Stock Market experiences constant changes. Stock prices normally are subject to change but in today's current pandemic the Stock Market has seen record breaking drops on all fronts.
	
Today, as the world faces one of the largest pandemics in history we have been able to see record breaking drops in all 3 major stock market companies. As demonstrated in the graphics below, S&P 500 Index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq have experienced a downward spike amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. 
	
The idea behind this project is to have the user understand basic financial concepts that are causing these drastic changes in the Stock Market. Users will be given basic Computer Science techniques in order to be able to understand and compare pre-covid stock prices to those that are present now.


### Interactive Component
_Each workshop must have an original, interactive component._

The interactive component in the workshop would be the users are able to choose what stock they would like to analyze for the project. 
	
After they choose their respective stock they are going to be able to see its previous pricing and then its present pricing due to Covid-19. 

The code will be pre-written and perform all of the calculations for the user. As the calculations are being run and the code displayed, the user will receive an explanation describing the change between prices and possible motives (these will be financial concepts).


### Code Deliverables
_In Weeks 1-3, your duo must code out the interactive component, as well as any other code needed for the entire workshop. 
What coding tasks do you need to complete? Each task should also come with what week each task will be completed as well as who is responsible for each task.
Please be specific._
_Also, you can use Week 3 to complete code deliverables. Note that this is highly **discouraged** because Week 3 is reserved for finishing touches for Stage 1._

These will be come up with soon...

### Timing
_Each workshop should be around 50-60 mins. How long will your workshop be?

The workshop/blog should last between the desired 50-60 minutes.

### Motivation behind project
_What motivated your duo to pursue this idea?_

The motivation behind this project stems from interest in the drastic change in today's stock market. The last time the Stock Market saw these record breaking drops we were in our first major economic depression. This is why we think it is valuable for users to have a basic understanding of financial concepts in order to be able to follow all that is going on in the stock market.
