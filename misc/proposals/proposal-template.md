# Workshop Proposal

### Specific Topic
_What will your workshop be about?_



### Interactive Component
_Each workshop must have an original, interactive component._



### Code Deliverables
_In Weeks 1-3, your duo must code out the interactive component, as well as any other code needed for the entire workshop. 
What coding tasks do you need to complete? Each task should also come with what week each task will be completed as well as who is responsible for each task.
Please be specific._
_Also, you can use Week 3 to complete code deliverables. Note that this is highly **discouraged** because Week 3 is reserved for finishing touches for Stage 1._
