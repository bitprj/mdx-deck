# Workshop Proposal

### Specific Topic
_What will your workshop be about?_

#1Our workshop will take the user through the statistics and data science implemented within algorithms that are created by quants for a given company that they are hired for. The simulation will begin with the very basics: what factors are taken into account when coding for the algorithm and why it makes sense that these factors are accounted for. Basically, the beginning of the simulation will prompt the user to create a completely theoretical algorithm. Once past a certain point, the user will begin having to account for factors that may disrupt the smoothness of their algorithm, and will see how real-life scenarios affect their code.
	Our workshop will help the user understand the relationship between the stock market and real world events. 
Given a repository of variables present in the stock market, the user will be prompted to choose two, thus displaying accurate definitions for each. The user will then be guided through the process of fetching variable values throughout any period of time through the implementation of the Yahoo Finance API. The user will then be guided through the process of plotting the variable values for the different periods of time. 
#2Throughout the simulation, a guide will be present to aid the user in maximizing the efficiency of their algorithm. This guide will be implemented through the use of a simple ‘help’ bubble that appears after certain checkmarks in the user’s coding process are met and can be called upon at any time by the user. The guide is sure to give clear and helpful explanations to ensure user comprehension. 
	#3At the start of the simulation, users will be given a repository of definitions for several, but not all, terms that are taken into account when applying mathematical and statistical methods to financial and risk management problems. No external (non theoretical) factors will be accounted for, and the simulations will be largely simplified to facilitate comprehension of basic concepts by the user. Users will have the ability to backtest their algorithm to ensure maximum efficiency and will be able to use past backtests to determine if a variable addition was beneficial or detrimental to their working algorithm. 
	#4After covering a large portion of the basic concepts relating to risk management, investments, pricing, etc., the user will run their model in a theoretically-controlled test run. In the case the user has created an algorithm that generates positive return but not optimal return, the user will be aided (by the guide) in maximizing the efficiency of their algorithm.
#5Once the user's efficient model has been created, they will then be presented with a series of situations that will alter the working proficiency of their algorithm. As these concepts cannot be accounted for easily through the use of automation, the user will be prompted to reflect upon how and why their results were skewed as they were.




### Interactive Component
_Each workshop must have an original, interactive component._

Self explanatory (see above)

### Code Deliverables
_In Weeks 1-3, your duo must code out the interactive component, as well as any other code needed for the entire workshop. 
What coding tasks do you need to complete? Each task should also come with what week each task will be completed as well as who is responsible for each task.
Please be specific._
_Also, you can use Week 3 to complete code deliverables. Note that this is highly **discouraged** because Week 3 is reserved for finishing touches for Stage 1._

### Timing
_Each workshop should be around 50-60 mins. How long will your workshop be?

With sufficient external mentoring, we believe that this project is able to be completed within the 5-week timeline, including use of the 5th week for code deliverables. However, because the difficulty is largely out-of-scope for the level that we are currently at in our computer science careers, this prediction is subject to change.





### Motivation behind project
_What motivated your duo to pursue this idea?_

The motivation behind this project stems from the world’s latest pandemic, the Covid-19 virus. As previously mentioned the user will have to account for factors that may disrupt the smoothness of their algorithm, and will see how real-life scenarios affect their code. Covid-19 can be one of the many real-life factors that have the ability to affect users' code. 
	The recent global pandemic has plunged the United States stock market into what are the beginnings of a major economic recession. While this recession will experience many fluctuations throughout the course of its downward trend, the economy is expected to be worse than the Great Depression in early 1930’s and the 2007-2008 Great Recession.
	Not only is this project insightful towards individuals understanding of fundamental computer science topics but it also gives a more in depth understanding of how real-life factors affect one of the largest trading platforms in the world, the stock market. 





### Explain difficulty/prior experience needed
_Is there any prior experience needed for this workshop? Please be specific._

This project is expected to be moderately challenging to implement. This project demands several concepts regarding human-centered design, including:
Repository of terms relating to the topic
User’s ability to access said terms
‘Guide’ feature to aid the user in both successful algorithm creation and concept comprehension
Dynamic ‘Backtests’ to determine if the given algorithm was successful
Display of said backtests
User-friendly program interface

Due to the prior experience of the two working partners in computer science-related topics, this project will be highly challenging to implement if left to our own devices. If possible, we would like to ask for a mentor/additional outside help in order to successfully implement this design. 


### Technologies that will be used
_Please be specific.

python, github
